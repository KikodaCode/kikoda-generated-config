## Usage

### Generaged Config for craco react apps
The Kikoda currently only supports `craco`.

Add this to your `craco.config.js`:

```typescript
import { GeneratedConfig } from '@kikoda/delivery';

const { fileName } = new GeneratedConfig({
  stage: "local",
  servicePath: resolve(__dirname, "./"),
  outDir: "public",
  additionalConfig: {
    // only for local environmental overrides... this will be dynamically populated at deploy-time for each stage
    platform: {
      backend: {
        endpoint: "http://localhost:8080/",
      },
    },
  },
});
â€‹
// only include config file stuff, no mfe config
module.exports = {
  plugins: [{ plugin: WebpackConfigFilePlugin(fileName) }],
};
```
